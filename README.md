# Self-Service Kiosk Simulation

## Overview
This Python script simulates a **self-service kiosk system** by tracking two types of counters:
1. **Session Counter** – Resets every time a new customer session starts.
2. **Kiosk Usage Counter** – Persists across sessions to track total customers served.

## Features
- **Session-based tracking**: Counts visits per individual session.
- **Persistent user tracking**: Maintains a cumulative total of all users served in a day.
- **Minimalist and efficient implementation**.

## Installation & Usage
1. Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed.
2. Download the script
3. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python self_service_kiosk_system.py
